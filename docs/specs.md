# Purr Specification

This is a draft of Purr's language specification.

Some of the features it offers:

  - Dynamically Typed;
  - Immutable everything;
  - Smalltalk syntax;
  - Ad-hoc polymorphism with protocols;
  - SQL Schemas and built-in ORM;
  - First-class SQL;
  - First-class HTML;
  - Literals for: Lists, Vectors, Sets, Maps;
  - Partial-application syntax;
  - Future-based concurrency;
  - Pattern matching;
  - Algebraic Data Types: Sum, Product, Extensible Records;
  - First-class modules;
  - Programming by contract;
  - First-class documentation (so we can have an interactive development env) â€”
    Decorators;


## 0) Prelude

Purr is a small domain-specific language for writing highly-concurrent
web-servers. It runs on top of Node, and integrates fully with its host,
so you can use any Node library. Most of the difference comes from the
fact that Purr uses promises all the way down, so you don't need to
concern yourself with callbacks and all that.

Besides this, Purr is a functional language with extensible syntax and
ad-hoc polymorphism (Clojure style). And it's syntax absolutely rocks
for writing RESTful services.
