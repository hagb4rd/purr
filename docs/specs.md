# Purr Specification

This is a draft of Purr's language specification.

Some of the features it offers:

  - Dynamically Typed;
  - Gradual typing with occurrence typing and higher kinds;
  - Immutable everything;
  - Smalltalk syntax;
  - Ad-hoc polymorphism with protocols;
  - First-class EDSLs;
  - Literals for: Lists, Vectors, Sets, Maps;
  - Partial-application syntax;
  - Task-based concurrency, Machine-based streams;
  - Pattern matching;
  - Algebraic Data Types: Sum, Product, Extensible Records;
  - First-class parametric modules with no global namespace;
  - Programming by contract;
  - First-class documentation (so we can have an interactive development env) â€”
    Decorators;


## 0) Prelude

Purr is a small domain-specific language for writing highly-concurrent
web-servers. It runs on top of Node, and integrates fully with its host,
so you can use any Node library. Most of the difference comes from the
fact that Purr uses Tasks all the way down, so you don't need to
concern yourself with callbacks and all that.
