Purr
====

Purr is a small functional language designed for writing concurrent
web-servers. It focuses on easy of development, security and concurrency.

(See the [Rationale](https://github.com/robotlolita/purr/wiki/Rationale) page
for more details)

> **NOTE**
>
> The language is still in **REALLY EARLY STAGES** of development. While it's
> usable, there's absolutely no optimisations in the compiler whatsoever, and
> the standard library and tooling are lacking many features. Do note also that
> the language is constantly changing at this stage.
